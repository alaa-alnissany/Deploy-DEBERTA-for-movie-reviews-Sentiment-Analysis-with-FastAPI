## Overview about DEBERTA model

DEBERTA (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) is a transformer-based language model architecture that was introduced in a research paper titled  ["DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03654) by Pengcheng He et al. in 2020.

The DEBERTA model builds upon the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and introduces several enhancements to improve its performance. Here are some key features of the DEBERTA architecture:

Disentangled Attention: DEBERTA introduces a disentangled attention mechanism that separates the self-attention into two streams: global and local. The global stream captures long-range dependencies, while the local stream focuses on capturing local context. This disentanglement helps the model better understand the relationships between words at different distances.

Masked Language Modeling (MLM): Similar to BERT, DEBERTA also uses MLM as a pre-training objective. In MLM, a certain percentage of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the original tokens based on the context.

Decoding Enhancement: DEBERTA incorporates a decoding mechanism during pre-training to improve the model's ability to generate coherent and fluent text. This is achieved by training the model to predict the next token given the previous tokens.

Large-Scale Training: DEBERTA is trained on large-scale datasets, including BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia. This extensive training helps the model learn rich representations of language.

Overall, DEBERTA aims to address some limitations of the original BERT model by introducing disentangled attention, decoding enhancement, and large-scale training. These enhancements contribute to improved performance on various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.
